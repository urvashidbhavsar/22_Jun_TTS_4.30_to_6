    <h3>Growth and standardization</h3>
    <p>
        During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early <b> 2000s</b>,<ins>client-side scripting</ins> was
        stagnant.
        This
        started to
        change in 2004, when the successor of <i><b>Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser</b></i>. Firefox was
        well received
        by
        many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.<sup><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">[21]</a></sup>
        <br><br>
        In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led
        to
        Mozilla working jointly with <del>Macromedia</del> (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X
        in their
        ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3
        as the
        new <mark>ECMAScript 4</mark>. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source
        project.
        However,
        Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation
        from
        Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.
